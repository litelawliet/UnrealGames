# UnrealGames
This is a project made in second year of Game Programming at ISART Digital Montr√©al. There are 2 projects inside, one is a platformer made in Blueprint, the other one is an arena game made in C++ both using Unreal Engine 4.

Both projects use the basic WASD and mouse controller like an FPS.

Platformer is the platformer game made in Blueprint.
Gladiator is the arena game made in C++.

These were an introduction to Unreal Engine 4.

- WASD : to move around
- mouse : to look somewhere
- left mouse : attack (only for Gladiator game).
